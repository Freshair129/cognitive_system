# FRAMEWORK — MoSCoW Method

## Intent

To establish a strict, shared vocabulary for categorizing product requirements and backlog items. This categorization ensures that critical functionalities are delivered first, while secondary items do not delay core releases.

## Core Directives

Every backlog item or feature request must be classified into one of the following four categories during Sprint Planning or backlog refinement:

1.  **Must Have (M):** Non-negotiable requirements. Without these, the release/PWA is considered failed or unsafe to operate.
2.  **Should Have (S):** High-priority features that add significant value but are not critical for the immediate release. They can be temporarily deferred or worked around.
3.  **Could Have (C):** Low-cost, "nice-to-have" features that improve user experience or aesthetics but have minimal impact on core metrics.
4.  **Won't Have (W):** Explicitly deferred requirements for the current phase or milestone. These are placed directly into the future backlog.

## Apply When

- **Sprint Planning:** Deciding which tasks enter the active sprint.
- **Product Requirement (PRD) drafting:** Categorizing raw requirements into release phases.
- **Scope Creep triage:** Evaluating newly requested features.
