# ADR — Distillation ratios are configurable defaults

## Context

The 8-8-8 protocol suggests a fixed 8:1 ratio for memory distillation (8 Sessions → 1 Core, 8 Cores → 1 Sphere). While this provides a strong conceptual anchor, the optimal ratio for different projects or agent types might vary based on session frequency and content density.

## Decision

We decide to make the distillation ratios **configurable defaults** rather than hardcoded constants.

### Default Values

- `distillation.episodes_per_narrative`: **8**
- `distillation.narratives_per_identity`: **8**

### Validator Rules

The validator will allow a range of `{2..32}` for these ratios. Setting a ratio outside this range requires an explicit `phase_override`.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Flexibility:** Allows different namespaces to optimize their memory accumulation based on real usage patterns.
- **Traceability:** Changes to these ratios are recorded in the central configuration.

### Negative

- **Drift Risk:** If ratios are set too low, memory might become volatile; if too high, identity promotion might take too long.
