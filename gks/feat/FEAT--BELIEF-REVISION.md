# FEAT — Belief Revision

## 1. Summary

The Belief Revision feature enables the `cognitive_system` to autonomously detect logical contradictions between newly acquired knowledge (Sessions/Narratives) and existing long-term beliefs (Identities). It manages the "epistemic health" of the system by regressing confidence in contested facts and providing a structured audit trail for belief updates.

## 2. Motivation

A system that never corrects itself is doomed to accumulate "knowledge debt." If an agent forms a belief (e.g., "The user prefers Python") but subsequent evidence suggests otherwise, the system must be able to recognize this drift and adapt. Without an automated revision mechanism, the agent's behavior will become increasingly decoupled from reality, leading to poor decision-making and loss of user trust.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Contradiction Detection
-   The system must automatically trigger a "Machine Judge" analysis when a new high-salience memory artifact is created.
-   Identify "logical tension" or "definite contradiction" between the new artifact and established Identity beliefs.

### 3.2 Epistemic State Management
-   Support regressing `epistemic_state` from `confirmed` to `contested` upon a single definite contradiction.
-   Maintain a `challenge_counter` to track the persistence of conflicts.
-   Support promoting `contested` back to `confirmed` if new evidence resolves the tension.

### 3.3 Automated Audit & Alerting
-   Generate a human-readable `AUDIT--BELIEF-REVISION` atom whenever a Tier 3 belief is contested or downgraded.
-   Each audit must include the specific conflicting evidence and the rationale provided by the judge.

### 3.4 Retrieval Weight Integration
-   Automatically penalize `contested` atoms in search results to prevent agents from relying on unstable knowledge.
-   Exclude `deprecated` atoms from retrieval.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] A functional hook exists in the distiller pipeline for contradiction checking.
-   [ ] Identity beliefs correctly regress to `contested` when presented with contradictory session data.
-   [ ] Contested beliefs appear lower in search results due to the RRF penalty.
-   [ ] Every state regression produces a valid `AUDIT` atom in GKS.

## 5. Connections
-   `[[CONCEPT--BELIEF-REVISION]]` — the strategic intent.
-   `[[FEAT--SEMANTIC-CONTRADICTION-JUDGE]]` — the engine used for detection.
-   `[[BLUEPRINT--BELIEF-REVISION]]` — the implementation plan.
