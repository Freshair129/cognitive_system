# FEAT — Decision Atrophy Guards

## 1. Summary

The Decision Atrophy Guards feature implements a proactive monitoring and reporting system for the lifecycle of GKS atoms. It leverages the `valid_until` frontmatter field to identify documentation that is potentially outdated ("atrophied") and mandates periodic reviews to ensure the knowledge base remains an accurate source of truth.

## 2. Motivation

Documentation that is never reviewed eventually becomes an "enforced lie." In a fast-moving monorepo, ADRs, ROADMAPs, and Plans can quickly fall out of sync with reality. Without a systematic way to track and enforce expiration dates, the system's cognitive reliability degrades. M9a aims to prevent this by turning documentation expiry into a first-class operational concern.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Expiry Detection
-   The system must scan all atoms in the GKS index.
-   Identify atoms where the `valid_until` date is in the past.
-   Identify atoms that are "near expiry" (e.g., within 14 days of `valid_until`).

### 3.2 Reporting
-   Provide a CLI command `msp-atrophy report` that outputs a summary of expired and near-expiry atoms.
-   Output should include: Atom ID, Title, Expiry Date, and Days Since Expiry (or Days Remaining).
-   Support `--json` format for automated ingestion.

### 3.3 CI Integration
-   Integrate with `msp:validate`.
-   **Expired Atoms:** Emit a `warning` (non-blocking for now, as per `PROTO--VALID-UNTIL`).
-   **Near-Expiry Atoms:** Emit an `info` message.
-   *Future Work:* Option to promote warnings to errors for specific high-stakes atoms (e.g., SECURITY policies).

### 3.4 Governance Flow
-   Provide a standard procedure for "refreshing" an atom (updating `valid_until` after review).
-   Integrate with the `ADR--DELEGATION-POLICY` to allow T3 agents to approve refreshes for L1/L2 atoms.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

-   [ ] A CLI command exists to list all expired atoms.
-   [ ] `npm run msp:validate` correctly flags expired atoms as warnings.
-   [ ] The system differentiates between `expired` and `near-expiry` states.
-   [ ] Unit tests verify the scanning logic across various edge cases (leap years, different timezones).

## 5. Connections
-   `[[PROTO--VALID-UNTIL]]` — the machine-enforced rule.
-   `[[CONCEPT--MSP-ROADMAP]]` §3 M9a.
