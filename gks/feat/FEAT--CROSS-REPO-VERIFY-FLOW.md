# FEAT — Cross-repo verify-flow

## 1. Summary

This feature extends the `gks verify-flow` command to support cross-repository verification. It allows a project (Repo B) to reference atoms in an external repository (Repo A) and verify that those remote dependencies are in a stable/approved state, ensuring governance consistency across distributed projects.

## 2. Motivation

In a microservices or multi-repository architecture, architectural decisions (ADRs) made in a central "platform" repo often govern the behavior and implementation of "consumer" repos. Currently, `verify-flow` only works within a single local vault. To maintain a unified governance chain, Repo B must be able to assert that the ADRs it depends on in Repo A are officially approved, preventing implementation against draft or contested decisions.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Remote Index Loading

- Support a `--remote=<repo-path-or-url>` flag in `gks verify-flow`.
- Ability to load and parse the `atomic_index.jsonl` from the remote source.
- Support for local filesystem paths (sibling directories) and eventually git URLs or authenticated HTTP endpoints.

### 3.2 Unified Atom Resolution

- The verification engine must merge the local and remote atom indices into a single resolution map.
- Prevent ID collisions by prioritizing local atoms or using a namespace prefix for remote atoms (e.g., `repoA:ADR--XYZ`).

### 3.3 Status Assertion

- The existing `isApprovedStatus` check must apply equally to remote atoms.
- If a local atom IMPLEMENTS a remote ADR that is still in `draft` status, the verification must fail.

### 3.4 Caching (Optional but Recommended)

- Implement a local cache for remote indices to avoid expensive network calls during every CI run.
- Provide a `--refresh` flag to force an update of the cached index.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `gks verify-flow ID --remote=../repoA` successfully walks a chain that spans both repos.
- [ ] Verification fails if a remote dependency is not in a stable/approved state.
- [ ] Clear error messages identifying whether the failed atom is local or remote.
- [ ] Unit tests covering the multi-index merge and resolution logic.

## 5. Connections

- `[[CONCEPT--MSP-ROADMAP]]` §3 M9c.
- `[[FRAMEWORK--PHASE-GOVERNANCE]]` — the policy being enforced across boundaries.
