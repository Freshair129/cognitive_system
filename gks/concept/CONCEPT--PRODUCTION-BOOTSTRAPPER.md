# CONCEPT — Production Bootstrapper

## Intent

To provide a CLI-based tool that can instantiate a fresh, production-ready Cognitive System project in a new directory. This separates the **Framework Development** (this repo) from **Production Usage** (the new instances).

## Problem

Currently, starting a new project (like CoVibe) requires manually copying files or cloning this repo and then "cleaning it up" (deleting design docs, ultraplans, etc.). This is error-prone and mixes framework debt with project implementation.

## Hypothesis

If we provide a command `msp-bootstrap <dir>`, the system can automatically:
1. Create a clean canonical layout (`packages/`, `apps/`, `gks/`, `.brain/`).
2. Copy the stable binaries and core logic.
3. Exclude the "scaffolding" (legacy design docs, temporary specs).
4. Provide a "ready-to-vibe" environment for EVA-CLI to start working immediately.

## Success Criteria

1.  A developer can run `npx msp-bootstrap ./my-new-project`.
2.  The resulting directory has a 100% green GKS state.
3.  The directory contains only production-essential logic, no framework design history.
4.  The framework repo (this one) remains the source for reference and editing of design docs.
