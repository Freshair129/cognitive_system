# CONCEPT — Belief Revision

## Intent

To provide a robust protocol for handling **contradictory evidence** and revising established beliefs. This ensures that the system can correct its own mistakes and adapt its "worldview" when faced with new, conflicting data.

## Philosophy

A healthy memory system must be able to change its mind. If a long-term belief (Tier 3 Identity) is consistently challenged by new session data (Tier 1), the system must proactively downgrade that belief, move it to a `contested` state, and eventually `deprecated` or reformulate it.

## Revision Workflow

1. **Conflict Detection:** The distiller identifies a contradiction between a high-tier belief and a new session artifact.
2. **Contestation:** The belief's epistemic state is regressed from `confirmed` to `contested`. A `challenge_counter` is initialized.
3. **Recovery Window:** The system observes subsequent sessions.
    - If supporting evidence returns → state moves back to `confirmed`.
    - If contradictions continue (threshold hit) → belief is **downgraded**.
4. **Downgrade:** The belief is removed from the Identity tier and converted back into a lower-tier Narrative for re-distillation or audit.

## Guiding Principles

1. **Stability over Volatility:** High-tier beliefs require *multiple* contradictions to trigger a downgrade, preventing knee-jerk reactions to single outliers.
2. **Auditability:** Every belief revision must produce an audit artifact (AUDIT--BELIEF-REVISION) explaining the "why" behind the change.
3. **Identity Preservation:** Fundamental identity beliefs (especially in the `safety` domain) have the highest resistance to revision.
