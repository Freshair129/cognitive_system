# Walkthrough: Monorepo Migration & Workspace Unification

The GKS/MSP ecosystem has been successfully migrated to a formal **npm workspaces** monorepo structure. This consolidation enables atomic cross-package development and shared boundary rules.

## 1. Structural Changes
- **Root**: Contains `package.json` (workspace manager), `CLAUDE.md` (unified rules), and `.github/` (unified CI).
- **`packages/msp`**: The passport orchestrator and memory orchestrator logic.
- **`packages/gks`**: The core Genesis Knowledge System storage engine.
- **`gks/`**: The knowledge content (atoms) remains here, as it is the "data" for the MSP.

## 2. Workspace Configuration
- Root `package.json` defines `workspaces: ["packages/*"]`.
- `packages/msp` now depends on `@freshair129/gks` via the `*` version (linked locally).
- Unified `.gitignore` at the root prevents accidental inclusion of `node_modules` and build artifacts.

## 3. GKS Hardening
- Fixed pre-existing build errors in `packages/gks` related to the `superseded` status and a missing CLI implementation for `backlinks`.
- GKS now builds successfully via `npm run build --workspace=packages/gks`.

## 4. Verification Results
- **Build**: GKS package built successfully.
- **Integration**: MSP indexer (`npm run msp:index --workspace=packages/msp`) successfully resolved and used the workspace version of GKS.
- **Monorepo Rules**: CLAUDE.md updated to enforce boundaries (GKS cannot import from MSP).

## 5. Next Steps
- **Import Refactoring**: Update internal relative imports in MSP source to use the workspace package name `@freshair129/gks` where appropriate.
- **CI/CD**: Update GitHub actions to run tests across all workspaces.
